# Diabetes-prediction
Repository created to store the notebook containing the code of an evaluation activity in the machine learning class of UFAL. 

The activity was used only to understand the techniques and the importance of pre-processing in model training, using a K Nearest Neighbors to predict whether or not a given individual has diabetes.

Work done with Ullyane and Rafael Augusto, where we reached 3rd place in the general ranking of the activity with this approach.

Notebook created on google colab.
